Flash memory, also known as flash storage, is a type of nonvolatile memory that erases data in units called blocks and rewrites data at the byte level. Flash memory is widely used for storage and data transfer in consumer devices, enterprise systems and industrial applications.

## What Does Flash Memory Mean?

Flash memory is a non-volatile memory chip used for storage and for transfering data between a personal computer (PC) and digital devices. It has the ability to be electronically reprogrammed and erased. It is often found in USB flash drives, MP3 players, digital cameras and solid-state drives.

Flash memory is a type of electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), but may also be a standalone memory storage device such as a USB drive. EEPROM is a type of data memory device using an electronic device to erase or write digital data. Flash memory is a distinct type of EEPROM, which is programmed and erased in large blocks.

Flash memory incorporates the use of floating-gate transistors to store data. Floating-gate transistors, or floating gate MOSFET (FGMOS), is similar to MOSFET, which is a transistor used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. Floating-gate transistors are electrically isolated and use a floating node in direct current (DC). Flash memory is similar to the standard MOFSET, except the transistor has two gates instead of one.

## Flash Memory in Enterprise Data Storage

Flash memory enables faster read and write speeds than memory in hard disk drives (HDDs) because flash drives have no moving parts. In data centers, where enterprises require rapid data access, flash memory allows businesses to quickly supply data for critical workloads.

Because flash memory requires no moving parts, flash drives like SSDs are also less likely to break than a hard drive. However, flash drives are still susceptible to drive failure, including read and write failures. Flash drives can only withstand so many reads and writes before they begin to wear. Some drives are suited more to frequent read cycles, while others are better suited to write cycles. 

## Types of Flash Memory

There are two types of Flash memory most commonly acknowledged: NAND and NOR Flash. NOR Flash was the first of the two to be introduced in 1988 by Intel, while NAND Flash was later introduced by Toshiba in 1989. Their main differences can be identified in their architecture.

NOR and NAND are named for the way the floating gates of the memory cells that hold data are interconnected in configurations that resemble a NOR or a NAND logic gate.
